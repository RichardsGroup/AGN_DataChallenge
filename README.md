This repository hosts information for the LSSTC AGN Data Challenge 2021 (PI: Gordon Richards). A github page is available at [here](https://richardsgroup.github.io/AGN_DataChallenge/). More (basic) information about this data challenge and the released dataset can be found at [About.md](About.md).

The dataset released for this data challenge is hosted on SciServer. To participate in this data challenge using the released dataset, please follow the steps listed below:
1. Set up an account on [SciServer](https://www.sciserver.org/)
2. Send us (Weixiang Yu/Gordon Richards) your SciServer username so that we can add you to the data challenge SciServer group for access to the data
3. Accept our invitation, see [here](https://github.com/RichardsGroup/LSST_training/blob/master/Setup/sciserver.pdf) for an example invitation
4. Get familiar with how to run a container (and correctly mount the shared volume) on SciServer, see [here](https://github.com/RichardsGroup/LSST_training/blob/master/Setup/Container.ipynb)
5. Set up the conda environment following the suggestions provided in the [setup](setup) folder
6. Explore the [getting_started](getting_started) folder, play with example notebooks and take off from there

If you want to learn more about how this dataset is built, serveral notebooks explaining the data construction are included in the [docs](docs) folder.
