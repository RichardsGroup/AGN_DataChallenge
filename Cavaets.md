### Some cavaets:
1. The labels are not 100% reliable! However the labels for the objects that have a `z` not eqaul to NaN are more reliable. 
2. ~ 1% of the objects don't have optical fluxes (selected using multi-wavelength data).
3. Bad fits are included for the CARMA(1, 0) and CARMA(2,1) parameters. We are limited by the tempoal sampling and the S/N of the existing data!
