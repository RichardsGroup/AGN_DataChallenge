    "This notebook goes over the light curve features computed for the sources that have corresponding time-domain data from SDSS, more specifically, the features that populated the `lcPeriodic` and `lcNonPeriodic` columns. The majority of the features computed are those mentioned in the 'Richards et al. 2011' (**R11**) paper (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.1959)). Some additional features computed include best-fit CARMA(1,0)/DRW and CARMA(2,1) parameters obtained using [EzTao](https://github.com/ywx649999311/EzTao) and those introduced by [FATS](http://isadoranun.github.io/tsfeat/FeaturesDocumentation.html). The __R11__ features and FATS features are computed using [$\\texttt{cesium}$](http://cesium-ml.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will briefly go through those light curves features by the index, starting with the `lcPeriodic` features. __Note__ that a 5 sigma clipping was applied before the following variability metrics were computed because the calibration issue of SDSS light curves as discussed in 'Schmidt et al. 2010' (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2642))."
